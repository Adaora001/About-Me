# About Me

Hello there! My name is Jennifer Nwokedike, I am an aspiring data analyst eager to embark on a career in data science. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Economics at the University of Lagos, where I'm gaining a strong foundation in critical thinking, resesearch and quantitative analysis.

I'm passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights and solve real-world problems. I'm excited to learn new tools and techniques, and I'm eager to collaborate with other data enthusiasts to build my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.
Feel free to connect with me to discuss data science, potential collaborations, or simply to chat!
